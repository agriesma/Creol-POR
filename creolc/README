This directory contains the source code of the compiler.

The general control flow is this:

The module `Driver.ml' contains the main entry point of the tool, the
function `Driver.main'.  This function parses the command line arguments,
sets up the transformation pipeline, and starts the compilation process.
Note that Driver.ml is a generated file.

The module `Passes.ml' contains rudimentary code for a pass manager.
This code will prepare passes and execute them.
