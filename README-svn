* share/interpreter.m4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the code of both the interpreter and the model checker.
It is used to generate the Maude modules INTERPRETER and MODEL-CHECKER in
the files interpreter.maude and modelchecker.maude.

If you need to apply changes to the interpreter, you have to edit the
file interpreter.m4, since all changes to the other files may be
overwritten.
