0. The golden repository rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To safe us the pain of incomplete build, mysterious errors, and the like,
any file that can be built from other source files *must* *not* be
checked into the repository.  This is especially true for pdf files,
because subversion is especially bad in handling different versions of
such content (and pdftex/dvips insist on embedding the compilation
time into the file, causing new and different versions to be created).
If you do not observe this rule, we also have to expect check-in and
check-out times in the area of hours.

1. Installing the dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building the creol tools from a subversion check-out requires more tools
in your development environment than just building the tools from a
source distribution.  Some generated files are included in the tar file
which are (in accordance with the golden rule) not checked into the
repository.  Make sure that you have the following programs installed.

  1.  Autoconf


2. Installing missing files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This also means that after checking out the creoltools, and installing
or making sure that all dependencies are met, these generated files
are recreated.  Fortunately, this is a very simple procedure.

  1. After checking out the project from the repository, execute the
     command `autoreconf -i -s'.  This will create the configure
     script and the templates for the `Makefiles.in'.


* share/interpreter.m4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the code of both the interpreter and the model checker.
It is used to generate the Maude modules INTERPRETER and MODEL-CHECKER in
the files interpreter.maude and modelchecker.maude.

If you need to apply changes to the interpreter, you have to edit the
file interpreter.m4, since all changes to the other files may be
overwritten.
