* Check uses before definition is seriously broken.  Correcting this may
  call for a different algorithm or a proper CFG representation.
* Implementation for merge is broken and currently disabled.  Some
  analysis go into P-SPACE with Merge, since we deal with shared variable
  concurrency in this case.
