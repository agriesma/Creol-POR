CREOL: An exciting mix of the best ingredients from many cultures!


CREOL: A formal framework for reflective component modelling

 The CREOL project is an ongoing research project 2004 - 2008, funded
by the Research Council of Norway through the strategic programme
IKT-2010. The goal of the project is to develop a formal framework and
tool for reasoning about dynamic and reflective modifications in
object-oriented open distributed systems, ensuring reliability and
correctness of the overall system.


@section Short project overview

Open distributed systems consist of geographically spread system
components subject to run-time modifications. These systems are
becoming increasingly important in modern society, for instance for
safety-critical infrastructure. A major challenge for safety-critical
open distributed systems is to ensure the reliability and correctness
of the overall system when components are dynamically modified, so
that development, maintenance, and upgrade of system components happen
in a controlled manner.

The CREOL project is a research project to investigate programming
constructs and reasoning control in the context of open distributed
systems, and in particular the issue of maintenance control, taking an
object-oriented approach. The project focuses on support for component
adaptability, combined with a platform for executable specification
and analysis of system models. This allows an investigation at two
levels: a theoretical framework for reasoning about software and
software updates, and a tool for practical experimentation with the
consequences and possibilities of the theoretical choices. The goal of
the project is to develop a formal framework and tool for reasoning
about dynamic and reflective modifications in open distributed
systems, ensuring reliability and correctness of the overall system.

These issues will be investigated in the context of Creol, an
experimental high-level object-oriented language for distributed
objects. The name is an acronym for Concurrent Reflective
Object-oriented Language. The language is based on concurrent objects
communicating by means of asynchronous method calls, and is formally
defined with an operational semantics expressed in rewriting
logic. The basic communication mechanisms and operational semantics of
the language are described in [9, 2]. The inclusion of multiple
inheritance in the language and the operational semantics is described
in [7]. A type and effect system for the language is given in [1].

Specifications in rewriting logic are executable in the rewriting
logic tool Maude. A prototype Maude interpreter for the communication
basis of the Creol language has been developed and extended with a
pseudo-deterministic rewrite strategy in order to better simulate the
non-determinism of a distributed environment [11].

The language and the interpreter will gradually be extended to
incorporate facilities for reflective programming, dynamic updates,
and a coordination language based on viewpoint specifications (or
behavioral interfaces) [12, 17]. An extension of the language and the
interpreter with a dynamic class construct is presented in [5]. A
binding strategy for method calls which is adapted to dynamic class
extensions is presented in [4]. A type system for runtime class
updates is presented in [3].


@section Features

Creol is a @emph{strongly typed} language, in the sense that it is
type safe.  Function and method calls which disregard data types
are rejected.

Creol is a @emph{statically typed} language.  The compiler tries to
infer, whether a function call or a method call is safe in the sense
that it will succeed.  Programs in which a call cannot succeed because
of the type of an operation or a method are rejected.

Message dispatch in Creol is based not only on the type of the receiver
of the message, but also on the arguments (multiple dispatch @cite{XXX}),
especially the type of the caller (which is constrained by the
@emph{co-interface} and available in any method body under the name
@code{caller}.

The @code{caller} mechanism is similar to @code{context} in Smalltalk-80,
but it does not, e.g., provide information on the call-chain.
