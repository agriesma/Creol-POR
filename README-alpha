This file is part of creoltools.

This document describes how to build pre-releases and SVN versions of the
package.



* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version of creoltools and not ready for production
use.  Please send comments to <kyas at ifi.uio.no>.

This software may change radically, contains bugs, may not be documented,
or the documentation may be incomplete, misleading, or plain wrong,
and will probably not do what you expect it to do.  Use at your own risk.

If you find errors, you may report them.  Please make sure that you only
have the latest version, and verify that your bug is still present in the
latest version.  Only if these conditions are met, we will try our best to
figure the error out and try to provide corrections.



* Compilation instructions

If you have taken the sources from SVN you will need the following
packages to build creoltools.  I don't make any extra effort to accommodate
older versions of these packages, so please make sure that you have the
latest stable version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- libxml2
- libxslt
- ocaml
- menhir

Please understand that I will not help you in setting up your build
environment.  Please make sure that you have the latest stable version
of these packages installed and correctly configured, including the
development packages.  If one of the steps described below fails, you
are out of luck.

Step 0: Obtaining the source code.

You may have received a tar file creoltools-x.ya, where x and y are
numbers and a is any letter.  This tar file contains a snap shot of the
creoltools, which should be buildable as a normal package.  See INSTALL
for installation instructions.

You can also check out the source code from our internal subversion
repository:

svn co https://sub.ifi.uio.no/repos/projects/credo/trunk/creolcomp


Step 1: Creating configure and Makefile.in

Execute `autoreconf -i -s' to install certain missing files and to create
the different Makefile.in and configure files.

On some sytems you may get complaints that AM_PATH_XSLT is missing.
Then make sure that you have updated your libxslt package to the latest
version, or try to find a file libxslt.m4 and install it in /usr/share/aclocal
or /usr/local/share/aclocal, depending on where autoconf will look for
its local macro files.

Step 2: Build the program

Follow the instructions in INSTALL to configure and build the program.
