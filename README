Credo-Comp

A compiler and type checker for Creol

==============================================================================
This small project serves as a prototyping environment for the compiler
and the type checker for Creol.  The idea is to see whether we can
implement something here and then port it to the Java environment for
"production use"

Personally, I think that OCaml is a much nicer language.
