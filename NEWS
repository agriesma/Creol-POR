creoltools 0.0d (2007-XX-YY): alpha release.

In the compiler:

In the interpreter:
To avoid errors on HFS+ file systems the runtime files of the interpreter
have been prefixed with creol-

Editing mode:
Pulled the maude mode maintained by Rudi and drop the older version from
the dirstribution.

Dropped the PDF from the distributed tar ball to keep the size of the
distribution reasonable.

An error in compiling the tool on MacOS has been corrected.

The configure scripts will warn about a missing maude.

The creol editing mode has been modularised into its own independently
distributable subpackage.


creoltools 0.0d (2007-06-13): alpha release.

In the compiler:
Renamed await wait to release and corrected the semantics of this statement.
`await wait' has been replaced by `release'.  `release' will always suspend
control, even in merge statements.

WARNING: The semantic may still change in merge statements.
The expression language has been extended to include tuples.
Perform the lowering of Creol to the interpreted Core Creol in the
compiler.  The equations doing this have been removed from the interpreter.

In the interpreter:
Accepts Creol but only the Core language.
Smaller changes and corrections to make "search" do something useful and to
optimize method binding.

A script for collecting some information needed for error reporting has
been added.

The emacs editing mode for creol programs has been improved a little
bit.


creoltools 0.0c (2007-05-07): alpha release.

In the compiler:  
Functions use parenthesis instead of brackets.
The operator precedence for expressions has been rewritten.
A pretty printer is provided, which can be called with the `-target creol'
option.
Output for the model checker can be generated with the `-target maydemc'
switch.
The script `creolshell' compiles a file and launches maude with the
compiler output.
Errors have been corrected.

In the interpreter:
Some mistakes have been corrected.  await wait is now treated like an ordinary
statement, which is never enabled and always ready.  This simplifies its
treatment.


creoltools 0.0b (2007-03-16): alpha release.

The package has been renamed to `creoltools' and the compiler to `creolc'.
The pretty printer has been improved and it does not emit so many parenthesis.
Corrections to the maude interpreter and the model checker were made.
Output can now be stored as XML, use the flag -x name to write the abstract
syntax tree to the file name.  By default the output will now be written to
`out.maude'.  The file name can be overridden by supplying the option -o name.
If printing to the screen is desired, use `-o -' or `-x -'.



creolcomp 0.0a (2007-03-05): alpha release.

Documentation is very incomplete.  Parser works for some examples,
some error messages are slightly meaningful, and it generates code
for the Maude interpreter.
