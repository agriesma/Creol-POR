creolcomp 0.0b (YYYY-MM-DD): alpha release.

Output can now be stored as XML, use the flag -x name to write the abstract
syntax tree to the file name.

By default the output will now be written to out.maude.  The file name can
be overridden by supplying the option -o name.


creolcomp 0.0a (2007-03-05): alpha release.

Documentation is very incomplete.  Parser works for some examples,
some error messages are slightly meaningful, and it generates code
for the Maude interpreter.
