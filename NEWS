creoltools 0.0b (2007-03-16): alpha release.

The package has been renamed to `creoltools' and the compiler to `creolc'.
The pretty printer has been improved and it does not emit so many parenthesis.
Corrections to the maude interpreter and the model checker were made.
Output can now be stored as XML, use the flag -x name to write the abstract
syntax tree to the file name.  By default the output will now be written to
`out.maude'.  The file name can be overridden by supplying the option -o name.
If printing to the screen is desired, use `-o -' or `-x -'.



creolcomp 0.0a (2007-03-05): alpha release.

Documentation is very incomplete.  Parser works for some examples,
some error messages are slightly meaningful, and it generates code
for the Maude interpreter.
